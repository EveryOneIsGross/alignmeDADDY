## alignmeDADDY 📎🖇😈

The philosophy behind alignmeDADDY is encapsulated in its name - it seeks to "align" the output of a chatbot's response with the moral framework found in our "play". This tool is not just about creating a chatbot; it's about crafting an experience that is both engaging and enlightening.

alignmeDADDY's novelty lies in its unique blend of algorithms and techniques. It employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for response generation, sentiment analysis to interpret the user's input, and keyword extraction to focus on the salient aspects of the conversation. Moreover, alignmeDADDY uses a caching mechanism to enhance efficiency and a multi-threaded approach to generate responses in parallel. This tool is not just about aligning AI to our Will, but rather, it's about discovering our Will by exploring its parameters through programming chatbots.

In the words of Aleister Crowley, a prominent figure in defining the path of spiritual growth for the individual, "Love is the law, love under will." This quote encapsulates the essence of alignmeDADDY - it's not about imposing our Will on AI, but about learning and understanding our Will together, under the guiding principle of love.

## How it Works

alignmeDADDY defines three character alignments: lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Each alignment has a distinct personality that guides their responses. The sentiment of the user's question influences the character's status, which can be good, neutral, or evil. This combination of alignment, status, and sentiment creates a unique context for each response.

The tool uses a multi-threaded approach to generate responses in parallel for each alignment. It also extracts keywords from the user's question and saves the responses, thoughts, objectives, and keywords for each alignment.

alignmeDADDY uses Gradio to create an interactive interface where users can chat with the different character alignments. The responses include not only the chatbot's reply but also its thoughts and objectives, providing a deeper insight into the character's personality and alignment.
